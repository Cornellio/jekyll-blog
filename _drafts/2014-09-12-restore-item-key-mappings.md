I use <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm</a> to control a collective of Linux servers. Since I have a strong preference for Mac key modifiers instead of PC modifiers, I use the Command key instead of the Control key. In order to use the Command key on Linux for important shell control commands like CTRL-A, E, K, and U, I remapped the modifier keys.

To enable the modifiers you have turn on support for assistive devices on your system. After upgrading to OS X Mavericks, this system preference was was disabled. I couldn’t find the preference pane when I went to re-enable it. It turns out it has been moved to Security &gt; Privacy &gt; Accessibility, under an ominously named list, “allow the apps below to control your computer.” To add iTerm to this list, open a Finder window and drag the iTerm icon into this list.
