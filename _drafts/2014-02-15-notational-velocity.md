I've been using Notational Velocity, there's a forked version, [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/)  that offers some brilliant enhancements like full-screen mode, vertical layout, menubar icon, and so on.

For those you not hip to the power of having instantaneous access to your often ephemeral, yet narrowly recorded thoughts, dreams, nightmares and ruminations, all with the convenience of cloud syncing, do yourself a favor and download it. You could opt for the original [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net), or the excellent fork [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/). Then go get [simplenote](http://simplenote.com) for your iOS device and your notes will magically follow you everywhere.

I made a key customization to my installation:

Full screen mode: I like it to match the keyboard command that Pages uses so I changed the keyboard command to invoke full screen to Command + Option + U. From ï£¿ Menu / System Preferences / Keyboard / Keyboard Shortcuts. Click + and choose Notational Velocity then type Toggle Fullscreen Mode and type the keyboard shortcut.
