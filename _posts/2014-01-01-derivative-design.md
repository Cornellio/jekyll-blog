The design of electronic products today are derivative of Apple. Consider Samsung smartphones. One could even argue that Android mimics iOS. Android certainly does bring some innovation to marketplace and contributes to the process of innovation through competition, but it's hard to ignore some of the forced design similarities.  

Emulation is easier than imagination but it makes less impact.  Instead of making copycat devices, designers should find their own unique language and pursue it with dedication.

Ever since the smashing success of the iPod every major consumer electronics company has stood up to say "me too!" First their was the Zune from Microsoft, then the Palm Pre, and Android. Then the iPad inspired a whole new wave of imitation: The Samsung Galaxy Tab, the HP tablet, the Android tablet and finally the BlackBerry PlayBook. Some of these are excellent products and contribute something valuable but I think the overall trend is to put out cheap products that lack spirit and imagination.

> The reason Apple is so successful is because they found a way to fundamentally apply design principles in a way that is uniquely Apple and is very compelling in every way. The wrong attitude is to say Apple did it that way, we’re going to do it that way — you need to keep that as a top layer, a level of importance, and find design principles that are uniquely yours.
