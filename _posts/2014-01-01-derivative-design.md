Many electronics products today are derivative of Apple. The infamous legal battle between Apple and Samsung is a telling sign of its prevalence in our world. I don't know if it's right to patent a software UI, but I find it tasteless when companies go to great lengths to mimic an entire product, from hardware design to marketing and even the unboxing experience. As a fan of open source software, I like the Android project and believe competition contributes to the marketplace but it's hard to ignore how forced it looks in terms of design similarities with iOS.

Emulation is easier than imagination but it makes less impact.  Instead of making copycat devices, designers should find their own unique language and pursue it with dedication. The designers at Apple have built a rich and unique design identity.

Ever since the smashing success of the iPod every major consumer electronics company has stood up to say "me too!" First their was the Zune from Microsoft, then the Palm Pre, and now Android and Amazon. Then the iPad inspired a whole new wave of imitation: The Samsung Galaxy Tab, the HP tablet, the Android tablet and finally the BlackBerry PlayBook. Some of these are excellent products and contribute something valuable but I think the overall trend is to put out cheap products that lack spirit and imagination.

[Yves Béhar](http://venturebeat.com/2010/09/30/apple-design-beha/) of Fuseproject: 

> The reason Apple is so successful is because they found a way to fundamentally apply design principles in a way that is uniquely Apple and is very compelling in every way. The wrong attitude is to say Apple did it that way, we’re going to do it that way — you need to keep that as a top layer, a level of importance, and find design principles that are uniquely yours.

In an [interview with Forbes magazine](http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterhigh/2014/08/25/yves-behar-is-the-most-influential-industrial-designer-in-the-world/), Béhar talks about industrial design and his time working at Apple:

> Well, I think at the time everybody was looking up to Apple. But at the same time, Apple wasn’t seen as a successful model. It was often derided and seen as such a minor player that wasn’t relevant at all.

> In contrast to that though, people were always talking about emulating Apple. So you had a company that had three or four percent of market share and yet, you would go to places like HP and Microsoft and they would still be looking at Apple. So there was some contradiction and insecurities around what Apple was doing, versus Apple in the market. I always found that really fascinating. Apple was really exciting, as a young designer, to work with. I don’t think they had found their way yet. However, everybody else  the other companies didn’t understand the power of finding their own voice. Design was looked as a way to match a competitor’s performance. Tech companies did not understand the concept of building their own design identity. Those lessons were learned much later and were hard to learn because they saw Apple, a minor player, become a major player.
